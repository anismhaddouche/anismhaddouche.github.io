  abstract = {The problem of estimating the scale matrix Σ in a multivariate additive model, with elliptical noise, is considered from a decision-theoretic point of view. As the natural estimators of the form Σˆa=aS (where S is the sample covariance matrix and a is a positive constant) perform poorly, we propose estimators of the general form Σˆa,G=a(S+SS+G(Z,S)), where S+ is the Moore–Penrose inverse of S and G(Z,S) is a correction matrix. We provide conditions on G(Z,S) such that Σˆa,G improves over Σˆa under the quadratic loss L(Σ,Σˆ)=tr(ΣˆΣ−1−Ip)2. We adopt a unified approach to the two cases where S is invertible and S is singular. To this end, a new Stein–Haff type identity and calculus on eigenstructure for S are developed. Our theory is illustrated with a large class of estimators which are orthogonally invariant.},

  abstract = {We develop indicators for teachers to monitor and regulate students' collaborative writing on a web-based science learning environment. Visualiza- tions of carefully selected indicators are proposed to teachers in order to facilitate the tracking, analysis and management of the students' collaborative work pro- cess over time. Our research method is based on a user-centered approach. Via focus groups and interviews, teachers have participated in the design of the indi- cators and visualizations. This communication presents (a) the mapping from col- lected data to educational constructs underlying our analytical approach for col- laborative writing, (b) indicators and visualizations produced to provide actiona- ble insights to teachers, and (c) lessons learned from our iterative human-centered design process. The results are transferable to other learning environments and design processes.}
