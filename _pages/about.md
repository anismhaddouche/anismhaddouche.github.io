Hello and welcome to my website.

Previously, I gained valuable academic experience as a Research Engineer at the [LABSTICC](https://labsticc.fr/en) laboratory, within the [MOTEL](https://labsticc.fr/fr/equipes/motel) team, where my research focused using Natural Language Processing to improve, the online notebook for writing and learning sciences, [LabNbook](https://labnbook.fr/en/home/). 

I also have a strong background in teaching and mentoring. From 2019 to 2021, I worked as a Temporary Teaching and Research Assistant (ATER) at [INSA de Rouen Normandie](https://www.insa-rouen.fr), where I helped students master complex mathematical and statistical concepts.

In addition, I continue to share my expertise as a freelance mentor on data-related courses at [OpenClassrooms](https://openclassrooms.com/fr/paths/164-data-scientist), supporting aspiring data professionals in developing their skills in Data Science, Data Analysis, and Machine Learning.
