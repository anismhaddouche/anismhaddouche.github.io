Hello and welcome to my website which is a tentative to gather my teaching and research activities.

I am a PhD on applied mathematics with a specialization in statistics. My research interests include decision theory, shrinkage estimators and multivariate statistics.

Currently, I am a research engineer at the [LABSTICC](https://labsticc.fr/en) laboratory within the [MOTEL](https://labsticc.fr/fr/equipes/motel) team since September 2021. I am also a freelance mentor on the [Openclassrooms](https://openclassrooms.com/fr/paths/164-data-scientist) data training paths (Data Science, Data Analyst and Machine Learning Engineer).

From 2019 to 2021 I was a temporary teaching and research assistant (ATER) at [INSA de Rouen Normandie](https://www.insa-rouen.fr).
